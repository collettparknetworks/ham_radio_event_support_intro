### overview
Template for new ham radio operators who might want to volunteer to support the RAMROD cycle race.

This is a working draft prepared by

attempting to clarify "things we would have liked to have known before we started the volunteering for radio support path, and had to be explained to us". 

While the RAMROD doc is specific to the RAMROD bicycle race, there is also a desire to abstract the effort for this event into a template that could be used to explain other events. The format is intended to be modularly styled such that others could extend the project to potentially include multiple intra-race documents (new Division Leads, interop between various support groups, supporting docs) that could be trivially versioned each year to make new documentation.
