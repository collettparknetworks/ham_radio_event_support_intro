# Description of the race/event

The RAMROD (Ride Around Mt Rainier in One Day) is an annual event that bicycle ride around Mt Rainier, either in mid-July (traditional) or early September (new protocol since 2024).

The event is a single circuit, starts and ends at Enumclaw, WA and can either be run Clockwise or CounterClockwise, a total distance of around 150 miles, with 10k ft of elevation gain.  The event started in 1984.


The race is cyclists timed against themselves, using staggered starting such that there is not a single peloton pack on the roads, and spreading out the riders. 

The race is managed by the Redmond Cycling Club who work in coordination with, and permission of, the National Park Service to orchestrate use of the roads on the southern and eastern side of the mountain.

## Broad description of support needs.
The event is supported by volunteer staff, over 300 in 2024 alone that oversee all aspects of the race.  

Volunteers include coordinators, water and food stop personnel, first-aid station personnel, static bicycle repair volunteers, mobile Support And Gear vehicles, and sweep vehicle personnel. Radio support personnel are either static stations at rest/aid stops, or mobile operators supporting SAG or mobile repair crew. 
In addition, formal resources such as National Park Service Rangers and Ambulances/EMS/EMTs work with Race staff for safety and coordination. 

The course is typically divided into 5 or 6 sections (divisions) for communications. Each section will have a lead, and anywhere from 5 to 15 hams under that lead.  Water stops, food stops, aid stations, and ambulances typically have hams assigned to them.  Virtually all assignments will require more than a handheld (as a minimum, a gain antenna, often more power like a mobile). 

The event is well organized and comes with mature preparatory meetings, coordination, and documentation for the riders as well as support staff. This includes a well-organized document for radio support (essentially an ICS-205) that covers divisions, personnel, roles, repeaters, and tactical frequencies.  

### Radio Support
Two main functions of radio personnel are providing voice and data communications across the race area to provide communications through areas without cell-service, and RFID (radio frequency ID) scanner stations to track cyclist positions on a stop-by-stop basis throughout the course.

When signing up you'll be asked a series of questions to sort out what you'd like to do (static/SAG/repair, etc) and what types of equipment and supplies (radios, EZ-ups, antennas, first aid or bike repair gear) you can supply or might need. This will all be captured in documentation, and can discussed in an online meeting a week or two before the event. Lack of equipment won't disqualify you from helping to support, and sometimes people will be matched who have complimentary equipment or skills. 


#### Types of bands and technology in use
- Race support radio types come primarily in 2 forms - Command Linked Repeaters that go around the mountain (VHF, some UHF) and Tactical Simplex static frequencies for Phone/VOX division to division commmunication.
- in addition to Phone/Vox support, APRS is used in mobile units, monitored by local static stations and mapping software in some locations, to oversee resource assignments and availability through the course.
- NPS Rangers monitor their own frequencies, and interoperate through OSCCR (On-Scene Command and Coordination Radio) radio units that Race Support Division Supervisors have access to.
- Some stations may have Starlink or other Satellite service and there may be some other equipment in place. Special digital equipment or Winlink modes aren't required.

## 10 things about radio support requirements for the race

1. HTs (5-10w with attached antennas) will likely have problems with the terrain. Mobile VHF/UHF units with external antennas that can operate between 20 and 50w are better for the difficult propagation terrain. HTs might be useful as backup units or for point to point monitoring or tactical.

2. Radio Operatators can, but aren't required, to use their own radios. Units can be assigned or borrowed for the event by operators. 

3. If using ones own radio equipment, frequencies and privacy tones should be pre-programmed before the day of the race, and tested if possible. You may arrive at your assigned place without pre-meeting with your division leadership, so test once you've arrived and set up, before the support time begins.

4. Support units need to be in location by a pre-specified time to be ready for expected cyclist arrival. The race starts early - around 4am - so some units may need to be ready very early, while others at static stations further down the route may need to be up and running later. Stations will have Starting and Breakdown times  and may breakdown and move forward for assistance once all riders have passed their division. The race officially ends in the early evening. You may prefer to camp in the Park or get a hotel nearby to make your assignment on-time.

5. There are up to 10 SAG vehicles (Support And Gear), which are mainly personal vehicles capable of carrying both riders and with bike racks for the bicycles.  These typically work the full event and move along the route as the bulk of riders move. Some SAG will trail the event. SAGs will typically have APRS and may have a Ham riding shotgun. As the day goes on riders and bikes may be ferried to further stops or back to the Start/Finish. Personal SAG Vehicles may be reimbursed for mileage.

6. Many volunteers from various ACS groups, PSRG, Cascadia, and Mike & Key, among others will be present, so you may be able to work with someone in your affiliated group who has done support in the past.


7. Fixed Stations should prepare to self-support for the entire day, regardless of the assignment. Some areas will have no structures, food, water, power or restrooms, so the Operator supporting the station will need to identify how they can set up their own antennas, power all required gear, stay safe in the weather (pop-up shelters, rain, etc are all possible), toilet access, and stay hydrated and fed. Some stations will also be water, food, or aid stations with other groups and potential supplies. Some stations will be solo-manned, some with other hams to manage multiple units or to take over for breaks. Ask questions to understand what your postiing will require before the race. The Rider's Guide will clearly state what stations have which planned services along the entire route.

8. You'll be on your own in terms of equipment. Test before the event, bring extra cables, connectors, batteries or extra backup units if possible. Once the race starts, driving home to Bellevue or Seattle and back for a part is not feasible, so be prepared for failures of equipment or forgotten supplies. 2 is 1, 1 is none. Checklists are your friend.


9. There are a number of Documents available in the Seattle ACS Google docs folder, or in other repositories your group will have access to. Some helpful docs will include:
- *insert year*  riding doc
- ICS 205 - Ham Support Frequencies and Divisions
- Paper Log (print out several sheets, depending on assignment)
- Event Supplies - a good list of standalone individual supplies for the assignments.
- RAMROD APRS Guide
- Medical Report
- Incident Packet
- Transportation Log
- Witness Report
- ???

10. if you have Red Cross First Aid certification, you may be able to provide first aid to your level of training, and you may wish to bring some basic supplies. Band-aids, pads, wrap, tape, saline for road rashes, alcohol or betadine pads, SAM splints, etc. First Aid kits are available from the RAMROD personnel, also. 

Ambulances and EMS support are available through Tactical relay for anything outside your level of expertise or supplies. Don't dispense pain relievers or offer care outside your level of training/certification.

There are normally two ambulances (one hired by RCC, and one from the Park). Both are supposed to have a Part 90 Public Safety Radio on the OSCCR frequency, which each Division Supervisor will have a radio for. Park Ranger vehicles are also supposed to be monitoring OSCCR if we need to contact them (and at least one will also have a ham with them).

11. If there isn't a dedicated bike repair station at your site you may be able to help provide tools, patch kits, or a floor air pump to let cyclists repair their own bikes. Ensure pumps have a Presta fitting which is more popular with road cyclists, and not just a typical Schrader (car-type screw on) fitting. For anything more intensive, you can call to division for the mobile repair unit.
