# Description of the race/event

The BICYCLEX is an annual event, which started in 1995 in which road bicycles ride from SPRINGFIELD to GOTHAM, held yearly in JULY. This year it will take place on SATURDAY, JULY 10th.

The event is a single leg starting at SPRINGFIELD and ending at GOTHAM, a total distance of about 150 miles, with 2000 ft of elevation gain.  


The race is cyclists timed against themselves, using staggered starting such that there is not a single peloton pack on the roads, and spreading out the riders.

The race is managed by the BICYCLEX Cycling Club who work in coordination with with MYSTATES Highway Patrol and the city of GOTHAM.

The main webpage for the event can be found on the [BICYCLEX Cycling Club website](http://example.org/BICYCLEX.html).

Some key organizing and support folks are:

- ALAN WATTS
- BOB SMITH
- CHARLIE WATTS
- DAWN SMITH

## Broad description of support needs

The event is supported by volunteer staff, over 500 in 2024 alone that oversee all aspects of the race.  

Volunteers include coordinators, water and food stop personnel, first-aid station personnel, static bicycle repair volunteers, mobile Support And Gear vehicles, and sweep vehicle personnel. Radio support personnel are either static stations at rest/aid stops, or mobile operators supporting SAG or mobile repair crew. 
In addition, formal resources such as PATROL OFFICERS and Ambulances/EMS/EMTs work with Race staff for safety and coordination.

The course is typically divided into 5 or 6 sections (divisions) for communications. Each section will have a lead, and anywhere from 5 to 15 hams under that lead.  Water stops, food stops, aid stations, and ambulances typically have hams assigned to them.  Virtually all assignments will require more than a handheld (as a minimum, a gain antenna, often more power like a mobile).

The event is well organized and comes with mature preparatory meetings, coordination, and documentation for the riders as well as support staff. This includes a well-organized document for radio support (essentially an ICS-205) that covers divisions, personnel, roles, repeaters, and tactical frequencies.  

## Radio Support

Two main functions of radio personnel are providing voice and data communications across the race area to provide communications through areas without cell-service, and RFID (radio frequency ID) scanner stations to track cyclist positions on a stop-by-stop basis throughout the course.

When signing up you'll be asked a series of questions to sort out what you'd like to do (static/SAG/repair, etc) and what types of equipment and supplies (radios, EZ-ups, antennas, first aid or bike repair gear) you can supply or might need. This will all be captured in documentation, and can discussed in an online meeting a week or two before the event. Lack of equipment won't disqualify you from helping to support, and sometimes people will be matched who have complimentary equipment or skills. 

## Types of bands and technology in use

- Race support radio types come primarily in 2 forms - Command Linked Repeaters that go around the mountain (VHF, some UHF) and Tactical Simplex static frequencies for Phone/VOX division to division commmunication.
- in addition to Phone/Vox support, APRS is used in mobile units, monitored by local static stations and mapping software in some locations, to oversee resource assignments and availability through the course.
- NPS Rangers monitor their own frequencies, and interoperate through OSCCR (On-Scene Command and Coordination Radio) radio units that Race Support Division Supervisors have access to.
- Some stations may have Starlink or other Satellite service and there may be some other equipment in place. Special digital equipment or Winlink modes aren't required.

## Common Radio Support Resources

1. HTs (5-10w with attached antennas) will likely have problems with the terrain. Mobile VHF/UHF units with external antennas that can operate between 20 and 50w are better for the difficult propagation terrain. HTs might be useful as backup units or for point to point monitoring or tactical.
2. Radio Operatators can, but aren't required, to use their own radios. Units can be assigned or loaned to volunteer radio operators.
3. If using ones own radio equipment, frequencies and privacy tones should be pre-programmed before the day of the race, and tested if possible. You may arrive at your assigned place without pre-meeting with your division leadership, so test once you've arrived and set up, before the support time begins.
4. Support units need to be in location by a pre-specified time to be ready for expected cyclist arrival. The race starts early - around 4am - so some units may need to be ready very early, while others at static stations further down the route may need to be up and running later. Stations will have Starting and Breakdown times  and may breakdown and move forward for assistance once all riders have passed their division. The race officially ends in the early evening. You may prefer to camp in the Park or get a hotel nearby to make your assignment on-time.
5. There are up to 10 SAG vehicles (Support And Gear), which are mainly personal vehicles capable of carrying both riders and with bike racks for the bicycles.  These typically work the full event and move along the route as the bulk of riders move. Some SAG will trail the event. SAGs will typically have APRS and may have a Ham riding shotgun. As the day goes on riders and bikes may be ferried to further stops or back to the Start/Finish. Personal SAG Vehicles may be reimbursed for mileage.
6. Many volunteers from various LOCALRADIOGROUP1 groups, GROUP2, GROUP3, and GROUP4, among others will be present, so you may be able to work with someone in your affiliated group who has done support in the past.
7. Fixed Stations should prepare to self-support for the entire day, regardless of the assignment. Some areas will have no structures, food, water, power or restrooms, so the Operator supporting the station will need to identify how they can set up their own antennas, power all required gear, stay safe in the weather (pop-up shelters, rain, etc are all possible), toilet access, and stay hydrated and fed. Some stations will also be water, food, or aid stations with other groups and potential supplies. Some stations will be solo-manned, some with other hams to manage multiple units or to take over for breaks. Ask questions to understand what your postiing will require before the race. The Rider's Guide will clearly state what stations have which planned services along the entire route.
8. You'll be on your own in terms of equipment. Test before the event, bring extra cables, connectors, batteries or extra backup units if possible. Once the race starts, driving home to Bellevue or Seattle and back for a part is not feasible, so be prepared for failures of equipment or forgotten supplies. 2 is 1, 1 is none. Checklists are your friend.
9. Documentation. There are a number of Documents available, provided by BICYCLEX HAM coordinator(s), and in other locations such as [supporting documents and references](#supporting-documents-and-references), below.
10. Red Cross First Aid certification is not required, but would be helpful in the event of an injury beyond a minor scrape. YOURSTATE's Good Samaritan laws should be reviewed to ensure you understand legal limitations and protections afforded to you when providing care to a participant. A basic First Aid Kit for yourself and for helping others in need is recommended. Many resources provide links to building a basic First Aid Kit. See the [Resources](#first-aid-resources) subsection for links. Ambulances and EMS support are available through Tactical relay for anything outside your level of expertise or supplies. Don't dispense pain relievers or offer care outside your level of training/certification. Ambulance(s) may have Part 90 Public Safety Radio(s) on the OSCCR frequency. Division Supervisors are supplied with an OSCCR transceiver to assist coordinating Aid Car locations and triggering incident response. Park Ranger vehicles are also supposed to be monitoring OSCCR if we need to contact them (and at least one will also have a ham with them).
11. If there isn't a dedicated bike repair station at your site you may be able to help provide tools, patch kits, or a floor air pump to let cyclists repair their own bikes. Ensure pumps have a Presta fitting which is more popular with road cyclists, and not just a typical Schrader (car-type screw on) fitting. For anything more intensive, you can call to division for the mobile repair unit.

## Does this answer Questions newbies might have

- what is it?
- how is it organized?
- what license/skills/equipment do I need to participate?
- do I need learn everything before the event, or could I be partnered with more experienced support folks and learn as I go?
- does it cost anything? how much does it cost? is it paid? am I reimbursed? 
- am I fed? do I get anything for participating?
- what sort of time commitment is this? Single day for the event? Multi-day? Am I required to attend pre-event or post-event prep or breakdowns?
- am I just doing ham? are non-radio skills desired or required?
